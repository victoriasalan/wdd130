    <p>Hi! My name is Victoria Salazar and I am from Guayaquil, Ecuador. I love spending time with my family and
      friends. I like outdoors activities, solving puzzles and currently trying to read a book that I bought a while
      ago. I enjoy long walks, specially during spring or fall since it's not too hot or too cold, just the perfect temperature!I'm trying to learn how to make desserts and my family are the ones trying my experiments lol.  I love watching movies with my family, even tho someone always falls sleep haha. I have 2 brothers, an older brother and a younger one, so that makes me the middle kid :). I work full time and it is rough sometimes to keep up with my educational journey lately but I'm trying to do my best. I am new to the coding world, so I'm doing my best to understand how it works. I was studying something related to public health but after a year, I decided that I needed to change my major as I was not feeling good about the one I was in.</p>

    <p>Ecuador is a multicultural and megadiverse country. It is full of a great variety of flora and fauna. Ecuador has
      many geographical areas, such as the Andean peaks, tropical rainforests and, 600 miles from the coast, the
      volcanic Galapagos Islands, home to animals and birds whose evolutionary adaptations shaped Charles Darwin's
      theories.</p>
