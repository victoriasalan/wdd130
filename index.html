    <p>Hi! My name is Victoria Salazar and I am from Guayaquil, Ecuador. I love spending time with my family and
      friends. I like outdoors activities, solving puzzles and currently trying to read a book that I bought a while
      ago. I am new to the coding world, so I'm doing my best to understand how it works.</p>

    <p>Ecuador is a multicultural and megadiverse country. It is full of a great variety of flora and fauna. Ecuador has
      many geographical areas, such as the Andean peaks, tropical rainforests and, 600 miles from the coast, the
      volcanic Galapagos Islands, home to animals and birds whose evolutionary adaptations shaped Charles Darwin's
      theories.</p>
